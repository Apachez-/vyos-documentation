  **Disable Ethernet flow control (IEEE 802.3x pause frames) on the interface.** 

   Ethernet flow control, defined by the IEEE 802.3x standard, temporarily stops 
   data transmission to prevent packet loss during network congestion. For 
   example, when a sender transmits data faster than the receiver can process it.

   Disabling Ethernet flow control means the interface will not signal the 
   connected device to pause transmission and will drop packets if overwhelmed. 

   Example:

   .. code-block:: none

     set interfaces {{ var0 }} {{ var1 }} {{ var2 }} {{ var4 }} disable-flow-control
