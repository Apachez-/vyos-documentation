VPP Dataplane Core Configuration
################################

This section covers the core configuration options for the VPP dataplane in VyOS. It includes settings for memory management, CPU allocation, hugepages, and other essential parameters that influence the performance and behavior of the VPP dataplane.

Please review the general system configuration, before starting to configure VPP. Without proper VyOS preconditions, VPP will not start or its efficiency will be significantly degraded.
