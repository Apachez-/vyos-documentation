Deploy VM
---------

Deploy VyOS on Azure.

1. Go to Azure services and click **Add new Virtual machine**.

2. Choose a VM name, resource group, and region, then click **Browse all public 
   and private images**.

3. Search for "VyOS" in the marketplace and choose the appropriate 
   subscription.

4. Generate new SSH key pair or use existing.

8. Connect to the instance with your SSH key.

  .. code-block:: none

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/vyos_azure vyos@203.0.113.3
    vyos@vyos-doc-r1:~$

Add interface
-------------

If your instance was deployed with one **eth0** (``WAN``) interface and you
want to add another, you must shut down the instance. To add a new interface,
such as **eth1** (``LAN``), attach it in the Azure portal and then restart the
instance.

.. note:: Azure doesn't allow you to attach an interface while the instance is
   running.

Absorbing Routes
----------------

If you're using the VM as a router, you can use a route table to absorb some or
all traffic from your virtual network (VNET) with your LAN interface.

1. Create a route table and navigate to **Configuration**.

2. Add one or more routes for the networks you want to route through the VyOS
   VM. For **Next hop type**, select **Virtual Appliance** and set the **Next
   Hop Address** to the VyOS ``LAN`` interface.

.. note:: To create a default route for VMs on the subnet, use
   **Address Prefix** ``0.0.0.0/0``. For a typical edge device configuration,
   configure masquerade NAT on the ``WAN`` interface.

Serial Console
--------------

VyOS includes serial console support by default. However, if you replace the
``config.boot`` file and reboot, ensure this configuration is present:

``set system console device ttyS0 speed '9600'``
