Update VyOS
===========

New system images can be added using the :opcmd:`add system image` command.
This command extracts the image and prompts you to use the current system
configuration and SSH security keys, allowing the new image to boot with your
current configuration.

.. note:: Only LTS releases are PGP-signed.

.. opcmd:: add system image <url | path> | [latest] [vrf name]
   [username user [password pass]]

   Use this command to install a new system image. You can retrieve the
   image from the web (``http://``, ``https://``) or from your local system.
   For example: /tmp/vyos-1.2.3-amd64.iso.

   The ``add system image`` command also supports installing new VyOS versions
   through an optional VRF. If the URL requires authentication, you can specify
   an optional username and password on the command line, which will be passed
   as "Basic-Auth" to the server.

If there isn't enough free disk space, the installation will be canceled.
To delete images, use the :opcmd:`delete system image` command.

VyOS associates configuration with each image, and each image has its own
unique configuration copy. This differs from traditional network routers where
the configuration is shared across all images.

.. note:: If you have personal files such as scripts that you want to preserve
   during the upgrade, store them in ``/config`` since this directory is always
   copied to newly installed images.

You can access files from a previous installation and copy them to your
current image if they were stored in the ``/config`` directory. Use the
:opcmd:`copy` command to do this. For example, to copy ``/config/config.boot``
from the VyOS ``1.2.1`` image, run:

.. code::

   copy file 1.2.1://config/config.boot to /tmp/config.boot.1.2.1

   configured appropriately for your installed release.

   For updates to the Rolling Release for AMD64, the following URL may be used:
