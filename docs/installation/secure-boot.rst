Secure Boot

Initial UEFI Secure Boot support is available (:vytask:`T861`). VyOS uses
``shim`` from Debian 12 (Bookworm), which is properly signed by the UEFI
Secure Boot key from Microsoft.

.. note:: There is yet no signed version of ``shim`` for VyOS, thus we
   provide no signed image for secure boot yet. If you are interested in
   secure boot you can build an image on your own.

To generate a custom ISO with your own secure boot keys, run the following
commands prior to your ISO image build:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd vyos-build
  CA_DIR="data/certificates"
  SHIM_CERT_NAME="vyos-dev-2025-shim"
  VYOS_KERNEL_CERT_NAME="vyos-dev-2025-linux"

  openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ${CA_DIR}/${SHIM_CERT_NAME}.key -out ${CA_DIR}/${SHIM_CERT_NAME}.der \
    -outform DER -days 36500 -subj "/CN=VyOS Networks Secure Boot CA/" -nodes
  openssl x509 -inform der -in ${CA_DIR}/${SHIM_CERT_NAME}.der -out ${CA_DIR}/${SHIM_CERT_NAME}.pem

  openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -nodes -keyout ${CA_DIR}/${VYOS_KERNEL_CERT_NAME}.key \
    -out ${CA_DIR}/${VYOS_KERNEL_CERT_NAME}.csr -outform PEM -days 3650 \
    -subj "/CN=VyOS Networks Secure Boot Signer 2025 - linux/"
  openssl x509 -req -in ${CA_DIR}/${VYOS_KERNEL_CERT_NAME}.csr -CA ${CA_DIR}/${SHIM_CERT_NAME}.pem \

************
Installation
************

As our version of ``shim`` is not signed by Microsoft we need to enroll the
previously generated :abbr:`MOK (Machine Owner Key)` to the system.

First, disable UEFI Secure Boot for the installation.

.. figure:: /_static/images/uefi_secureboot_01.png
   :alt: Disable UEFI secure boot

Proceed with the standard VyOS :ref:`installation <permanent_installation>` on
your system. Instead of the final ``reboot`` command, enroll the
:abbr:`MOK (Machine Owner Key)`.

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos:~$ install mok
  input password:
  input password again:

You can set the ``input password`` to any value you choose. You'll need this
password after reboot when MOK Manager launches to permanently install the keys.

With the next reboot, MOK Manager will automatically launch

Select ``Enroll MOK``

You can now view the key to be installed and continue with key installation.

Now you need to enter the password you defined previously.

Now reboot and re-enable UEFI Secure Boot.

   :alt: Disable UEFI secure boot

VyOS will now launch in UEFI Secure Boot mode. You can verify this by running
one of the following commands:

.. code-block:: none

  vyos@vyos:~$ show secure-boot
  SecureBoot enabled

.. code-block:: none

   vyos@vyos:~$ show log kernel | match Secure
   Oct 08 19:15:41 kernel: Secure boot enabled

.. code-block:: none

************
Image Update
************

.. note:: Currently, there is no signed version of ``shim`` for VyOS. If you
   want Secure Boot support, you can build a custom image with your own keys.

During image installation, you install your :abbr:`MOK (Machine Owner Key)`
into the UEFI variables to add trust to this key. After you re-enable Secure
Boot in UEFI, you can only boot into your signed image.

You can no longer boot into a CI-generated rolling release because those
are not signed by a trusted party (:vytask:`T861` work in progress). This
also means you must sign all successor builds with the same key; otherwise,
you'll see this error:

.. code-block:: none

  error: bad shim signature
  error: you need to load the kernel first

************
Linux Kernel
************

In addition to Secure Boot support, VyOS uses ephemeral key signing of Linux
Kernel modules for an extra security layer in both Secure and non-Secure boot
images.

.. stop_vyoslinter

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-integrity/patch/20210218220011.67625-5-nayna@linux.ibm.com/

.. start_vyoslinter

When the CI system builds a Kernel package and required third-party modules,
it generates a temporary (ephemeral) key pair for signing the modules. The
public key is embedded in the Kernel binary to verify loaded modules.

After the Kernel CI build completes, the generated key is discarded, meaning
we can no longer sign additional modules with that key. The Kernel configuration
also includes the option ``CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE=y``, which enforces signature
verification for all modules. If you try to load an unsigned module, you'll
get this error:

``insmod: ERROR: could not insert module malicious.ko: Key was rejected by
service``

This prevents loading any malicious code after the image is assembled into the
Kernel as a module. You can disable this behavior on custom builds if needed.

************
Troubleshoot
************

In most cases, if something goes wrong during system boot, you'll see this
error message:

.. code-block:: none

  error: bad shim signature
  error: you need to load the kernel first

This error means the Machine Owner Key used to sign the Kernel is not trusted
by your UEFI. Install the MOK using the ``install mok`` command as described
above.
