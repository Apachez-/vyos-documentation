OpenVPN
#######

Traditionally hardware routers implement IPsec exclusively due to relative
ease of implementing it in hardware and insufficient CPU power for doing
encryption in software. Since VyOS is a software router, this is less of a
concern. OpenVPN has been widely used on the UNIX platform for a long time and
is a popular option for remote access VPN, though it's also capable of
site-to-site connections.

Advantages of OpenVPN are:

* It uses a single TCP or UDP connection and does not rely on packet source
  addresses, so it will work even through a double NAT: perfect for public
  hotspots and such

* It's easy to setup and offers very flexible split tunneling

* There's a variety of client GUI frontends for any platform

Disadvantages are:

* It's slower than IPsec due to higher protocol overhead and the fact it runs
  in user mode while IPsec, on Linux, is in kernel mode

* None of the operating systems have client software installed by default

In the VyOS CLI, a key point often overlooked is that rather than being
configured using the `set vpn` stanza, OpenVPN is configured as a network
`interface using `set interfaces openvpn`.

   * **server** - acts as server in server-client mode

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces openvpn <interface> offload dco

   OpenVPN Data Channel Offload (DCO) enables significant performance enhancement
   in encrypted OpenVPN data processing. By minimizing context switching for each
   packet, DCO effectively reduces overhead. This optimization is achieved by
   keeping most data handling tasks within the kernel, avoiding frequent switches
   between kernel and user space for encryption and packet handling.

   As a result, the processing of each packet becomes more efficient, 
   potentially leveraging hardware encryption offloading support available in 
   the kernel.

   .. note:: OpenVPN DCO is not a fully supported OpenVPN feature, and is currently
      considered experimental. Furthermore, there are certain OpenVPN features and
      use cases that remain incompatible with DCO. To get a comprehensive
      understanding of the limitations associated with DCO, refer to the list of
      known limitations in the documentation.

      https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/DataChannelOffload/Features


   Enabling OpenVPN DCO
   ====================

   DCO support is a per-tunnel option and it is not automatically enabled by
   default for new or upgraded tunnels. Existing tunnels will continue to function
   as they have in the past.

   DCO can be enabled for both new and existing tunnels. VyOS adds an option in
   each tunnel configuration where we can enable this function. The current best
   practice is to create a new tunnel with DCO to minimize the chance of problems
   with existing clients.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: none

     set interfaces openvpn vtun0 offload dco

   Enable OpenVPN Data Channel Offload feature by loading the appropriate kernel
   module.

   Disabled by default - no kernel module loaded.

   .. note:: Enable this feature causes an interface reset.
 
.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces openvpn <interface> openvpn-option <text>
 
   OpenVPN has a lot of options, all of them are not included in VyOS CLI. 
   If an option is missing, a feature request may be opened at Phabricator_ so 
   all users can benefit from it (see :ref:`issues_features`). Alternatively,
   use ``openvpn-option`` for passing raw OpenVPN options to openvpn.conf file.  

   .. note:: Please use this only as last resort - things might break and OpenVPN 
      wonâ€™t start if you pass invalid options/syntax. Check system logs for errors.

   Example:

   .. code-block:: none 

     set interfaces openvpn vtun0 openvpn-option 'persist-key'

   This will add ``persist-key`` to the generated OpenVPN configuration. This 
   option solves the problem by persisting keys across resets, so they 
   don't need to be re-read.

   .. code-block:: none

     set interfaces openvpn vtun0 openvpn-option 'route-up &quot;/config/auth/tun_up.sh arg1&quot;'

   This will add ``route-up "/config/auth/tun_up.sh arg1"`` to the generated OpenVPN
   config file. This option is executed after connection authentication, either
   immediately after, or some number of seconds after as defined. The path and 
   arguments need to be single- or double-quoted.

   .. note:: Sometimes option lines in the generated OpenVPN configuration require
      quotes. This is done through a hack on our config generator. You can pass
      quotes using the ``&quot;`` statement.

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces openvpn <interface> persistent-tunnel

   This option prevents the TUN/TAP device from closing or reopening on 
   connection resets or daemon reloads.

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces openvpn <interface> protocol <udp | tcp-passive | tcp-active >
