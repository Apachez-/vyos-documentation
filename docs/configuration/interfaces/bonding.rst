Bond / link aggregation
#######################

A **bonding interface** aggregates multiple network interfaces into a single 
logical interface (referred to as a bond, :abbr:`LAG (Link Aggregation Group)`, 
EtherChannel, or port-channel).

The behavior of a bonding interface depends on the selected mode. Modes provide 
either fault tolerance or a combination of load balancing and fault tolerance. 
Additionally, the bonding interface can be configured for link integrity 
monitoring.


*************
Configuration
*************

Common interface configuration
==============================

.. cmdinclude:: /_include/interface-common-with-dhcp.txt
   :var0: bonding
   :var1: bond0

Member interfaces
=================

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> member interface <member>

  **Add an interface to the bonding group.**

  **Example:**

  To configure eth0 and eth1 as members of the bonding interface bond0, execute 
  the following commands:

.. code-block:: none

   set interfaces bonding bond0 member interface eth0
   set interfaces bonding bond0 member interface eth1

Bond modes
============

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> mode <802.3ad | active-backup |
  broadcast | round-robin | transmit-load-balance | adaptive-load-balance |
  xor-hash>

   **Configure the bonding mode on the interface. The default mode is** 
   ``802.3ad``.

   The available modes are:

   * ``802.3ad`` 
  
   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80

      * - **Description:**
        - IEEE 802.3ad Dynamic Link Aggregation. Groups only member interfaces with 
          the same speed (e.g., 1 Gbps) and duplex settings. Member interfaces with 
          different speed and duplex settings are not included in the active bond.

          Provides load balancing and fault tolerance. Uses the :abbr:`LACP (Link 
          Aggregation Control Protocol)` to negotiate the bond with the switch.  
      * - **Traffic distribution:**
        - Traffic is distributed according to the **transmit hash policy** 
          (default: XOR). 

          The bonding driver applies an XOR operation to specific packet header fields, 
          generating a hash value that maps to a particular member interface. This 
          ensures the same network flow is consistently transmitted over the same member 
          interface. 
        
          The transmit hash policy is configured via the ``hash-policy`` option.
      * - **Failover:**
        - If a member interface fails, the hash is recalculated to distribute 
          traffic among the remaining active member interfaces.

   .. note:: Not all transmit hash policies comply with 802.3ad, particularly
      section 43.2.4. Using a non-compliant policy may result in out-of-order
      packet delivery.

   * ``active-backup`` 

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80
 
      * - **Description:**
        - Provides fault tolerance. Only one member interface is active at a time. 
          Other member interfaces remain in a standby mode.  
      * - **Traffic distribution:**         
        - All traffic (incoming and outgoing) is routed via one active member interface.
      * - **Failover:**         
        - If the designated member interface fails, all traffic is routed to
          another member interface. The bonding driver sends a Gratuitous ARP 
          to update the peer's MAC address table, linking the bond's MAC address 
          to another physical port.

   * ``broadcast``

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80
 
      * - **Description:**
        - Provides maximum fault tolerance by duplicating traffic.
      * - **Traffic distribution:**         
        - Every packet is duplicated and transmitted on **all** member interfaces.
      * - **Failover:**         
        - Traffic flow is not interrupted as long as at least one member interface 
          remains active.

   * ``round-robin``   

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80
 
      * - **Description:**
        - Provides load balancing and fault tolerance.
      * - **Traffic distribution:**         
        - Packets are transmitted in sequential order across the member interfaces 
          (e.g., packet 1 > interface A, packet 2 > interface B, etc.).
      * - **Failover:**         
        - If a member interface fails, the sequence skips the failed interface and 
          continues with the remaining active members.

   * ``transmit-load-balance``   

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80
 
      * - **Description:**
        - Provides adaptive transmit load balancing and fault tolerance.
      * - **Traffic distribution:**         
        - **Outgoing:** Distributed across all active member interfaces based on 
          the current load.

          **Incoming:** Received by a designated member interface (active receiver).
      * - **Failover:**         
        - If the active receiver fails, another member interface takes over as the new 
          active receiver.

   * ``adaptive-load-balance``

   .. list-table::
      :widths: 20 80

      * - **Description:**
        - Provides adaptive transmit load balancing identical to 
          ``transmit-load-balance``, receive load balancing for IPv4 traffic, and fault 
          tolerance for both incoming and outgoing traffic.
      * - **Traffic distribution:**
        - **Outgoing:** Identical to ``transmit-load-balance``.

          **Incoming:** Distributed based on ARP manipulation. For both local and remote
          connections, the bonding driver intercepts ARP traffic and changes the source
          MAC address to the MAC address of the least loaded member interface. 

          All traffic from that peer is then routed to the chosen member interface.
      * - **Failover:**
        - If a member interface's state changes (fails, recovers, is added, or excluded),
          the traffic is redistributed among all active member interfaces.

   * ``xor-hash``: Provides load balancing and fault tolerance based on a hash formula. 
     Distributes traffic and handles failover identically to ``802.3ad``, but operates 
     without the :abbr:`LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)`.

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> min-links <0-16>

   **Configure how many member interfaces must be active (in the link-up state) to 
   mark the bonding interface UP (carrier asserted).**

   This command applies only when the bonding interface is configured in 802.3ad 
   mode and functions like the Cisco EtherChannel min-links feature. It ensures 
   that a bonding interface is marked UP (carrier asserted) only when a specified 
   number of member interfaces are active (in the link-up state). This helps 
   guarantee a minimum level of bandwidth for higher-level services (such as 
   clustering) relying on the bonding interface. 

   The default value is 0. This marks the bonding interface UP (carrier asserted) 
   whenever an active LACP aggregator exists, regardless of the number of member 
   interfaces in that aggregator. 

   .. note:: In 802.3ad mode, a bond cannot be active without at least one active 
      member interface. Therefore, setting min-links to 0 or 1 has the same result: 
      the bonding interface is marked UP (carrier asserted).

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> lacp-rate <slow|fast>

   **Configure the rate at which the bonding interface requests its link 
   partner to send** :abbr:`LACPDUs (Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data 
   Units)` **in 802.3ad mode.**

   This command applies only when the bonding interface is configured in 
   802.3ad mode.

   The following options are available:

   * **slow (default):** Requests the link partner to transmit LACPDUs every 30 seconds.

   * **fast:** Requests the link partner to transmit LACPDUs every 1 second. 


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> system-mac <mac address>

   **Configure a specific MAC address for the bonding interface.**

   This sets the 802.3ad system MAC address, which is used for :abbr:`LACPDU (Link 
   Aggregation Control Protocol Data Unit)` exchanges with the link partner. 
   You can assign a fixed MAC address or generate a random one for these 
   :abbr:`LACPDU (Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data Unit)` exchanges. 


.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> hash-policy <policy>

   **Configure which transmit hash policy to use for distributing traffic across 
   member interfaces.**

   The following policies are available:

   * ``layer2``

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80

        * - **Description:**
          - Routes all traffic destined for a specific network peer through the same 
            member interface. The policy is 802.3ad-compliant.
        * - **Hash inputs:**
          - Source MAC address, destination MAC address, and Ethernet packet type ID. 
        * - **Formula:**
          - .. code-block:: none

               hash = source MAC address XOR destination MAC address XOR packet type ID
               member interface number = hash modulo member interface count

   * ``layer2+3``

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80

        * - **Description:**
          - Similar to ``layer2``, routes all traffic destined for a specific network 
            peer through the same member interface and is IEEE 802.3ad-compliant. Uses 
            both Layer 2 and Layer 3 information to provide a more balanced traffic distribution.
        * - **Hash inputs:**
          - * Source MAC address, destination MAC address, and Ethernet packet type ID.
            * Source IP address, destination IP address. IPv6 addresses are first hashed 
              using ``IPv6_addr_hash``. 
        * - **Formula:**
          - .. code-block:: none

               hash = source MAC address XOR destination MAC address XOR packet type ID
               hash = hash XOR source IP address XOR destination IP address
               hash = hash XOR (hash RSHIFT 16)
               hash = hash XOR (hash RSHIFT 8)
               member interface number = hash modulo member interface count
         
            For non-IP traffic, the formula is the same as for ``layer2``.

   * ``layer3+4``

     .. list-table::
        :widths: 20 80

        * - **Description:**
          - Routes different connections (flows) destined for a specific network peer 
            through multiple member interfaces, but ensures each individual flow is 
            routed through only one member interface.

            .. note:: This policy is not fully 802.3ad-compliant. When a single TCP 
               or UDP flow contains both fragmented and unfragmented packets, the 
               algorithm may distribute them across different member interfaces. This 
               may result in out-of-order packet delivery, violating the 802.3ad standard.
        * - **Hash inputs:**
          - * Source port, destination port (if available).
            * Source IP address, destination IP address. IPv6 addresses are first hashed 
              using ``IPv6_addr_hash``. 
        * - **Formula:**
          - .. code-block:: none

               hash = source port, destination port (as in the header)
               hash = hash XOR source IP address XOR destination IP address
               hash = hash XOR (hash RSHIFT 16)
               hash = hash XOR (hash RSHIFT 8)
               member interface number = hash modulo member interface count

            For fragmented TCP or UDP packets and all other IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, the 
            source and destination port information is omitted.

            For non-IP traffic, the formula is the same as for ``layer2``.
 
.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> primary <interface>

   **Configure the primary member interface in the bond.**

   The primary member interface remains active as long as it is operational; 
   alternative member interfaces are used only if it fails. 

   Use this configuration when a specific member interface is preferred, 
   such as one with higher throughput.

   This command applies only to ``active-backup``, ``transmit-load-balance``, and 
   ``adaptive-load-balance`` modes.

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> arp-monitor interval <time>

   **Configure the ARP monitoring interval, in seconds, for the bonding interface.**

   ARP monitoring periodically assesses the health of each member interface by 
   checking whether it has recently sent or received traffic (this criterion 
   varies depending on the bonding mode and the member interface’s state). ARP 
   probes are sent to the IP addresses specified with the arp-monitor target option.

   When ARP monitoring is used with EtherChannel-compatible modes (such as 
   ``round-robin`` or ``xor-hash``), the switch should be configured to distribute 
   traffic across all member interfaces. If the switch distributes traffic using 
   an XOR-based policy, all ARP replies will be received on one member interface, 
   causing other member interfaces to be incorrectly marked as failed. 

   Setting this value to 0 disables ARP monitoring.

   The default value is 0.

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> arp-monitor target <address>

   **Configure the IP addresses for ARP monitoring requests.**

   The bonding driver sends ARP requests to these IP addresses to check the 
   state of member interfaces.

   To enable ARP monitoring, configure at least one IP address (up to 16 per 
   bonding interface). 

   By default, no IP addresses are configured.

EVPN multihoming
----------------

EVPN multihoming (EVPN-MH) is a standards-based solution (RFC 7432, RFC 8365) 
that enables Customer Edge (CE) devices, such as servers, to connect to two 
or more Provider Edge (PE) devices for redundancy and load balancing. 

EVPN-MH is often used as a modern, standards-based alternative to 
:abbr:`MLAG (Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation)` and :abbr:`VTEPs (Virtual 
Tunnel Endpoints)`. 

**Ethernet Segment (ES) and Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI)**

Physical links that connect a CE device to PE devices are bundled using link 
aggregation. This logical bundle is called an Ethernet Segment (ES) and is 
uniquely identified by an Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) within the 
EVPN domain.

To enable EVPN-MH, configure the same ESI on the bonding interfaces of all 
PE devices connected to a single CE device.

An ESI is configured by specifying either a system MAC address and a local 
discriminator, or an Ethernet Segment Identifier Name (ESINAME).

The following two commands generate a 10-byte Type-3 ESI by combining the 
system MAC and local discriminator: 

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> evpn es-id <1-16777215|10-byte ID>
.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> evpn es-sys-mac <xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx>

  Alternatively, assign an ESINAME directly as a 10-byte Type-0 ESI using the 
  following format: 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF:GG:HH:II.

  **BGP-EVPN route usage**

  EVPN-MH uses BGP-EVPN route types 1 and 2 for ES discovery and MAC-IP 
  synchronization:

  * **Type 1 (EAD-per-ES and EAD-per-EVI)** routes advertise the locally 
    attached ESs and discover remote ESs in the network. 
  * **Type 2 (MAC-IP advertisement)** routes are advertised with a 
    destination ESI, enabling MAC-IP synchronization between ES peers.

.. cfgcmd:: set interfaces bonding <interface> evpn es-df-pref <1-65535>

  **Configure the** :abbr:`DF (Designated Forwarder)` **preference (1-65535) for 
  the interface. A higher value indicates a higher preference to become the** 
  :abbr:`DF (Designated Forwarder)`. **The** :abbr:`DF (Designated Forwarder)` 
  **preference is configured per-ES.**

  The DF election process determines which interface in a specific ES forwards 
  :abbr:`BUM (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, and Multicast)` traffic from the EVPN 
  overlay to the connected CE device. EVPN Type-4 (Ethernet Segment) routes are 
  used to elect the DF, implementing the preference-based election method defined 
  in RFC 9785.

  Interfaces not elected as the DF drop any BUM traffic from the EVPN overlay 
  using non-DF filters. Similarly, traffic received from ES peers via the EVPN 
  overlay is blocked from forwarding to the CE device to maintain split-horizon 
  filtering with local bias.

*******
Example
*******

The following configuration example applies to all listed third-party vendors. 
It creates a bonding interface with two member interfaces, defines VLANs 10 
and 100 on the bonding interface, and assigns an IPv4 address to each VLAN 
subinterface.

.. code-block:: none

  # Create the bonding interface bond0 with 802.3ad LACP
  set interfaces bonding bond0 hash-policy 'layer2'
  set interfaces bonding bond0 mode '802.3ad'

  # Add the required VLANs and IPv4 addresses on them
  set interfaces bonding bond0 vif 10 address 192.168.0.1/24
  set interfaces bonding bond0 vif 100 address 10.10.10.1/24

  # Add the member interfaces to the bonding interface
  set interfaces bonding bond0 member interface eth1
  set interfaces bonding bond0 member interface eth2

.. note:: If you are running this configuration in a virtual environment like 
   EVE-NG, ensure the e1000 driver is chosen for your VyOS NIC. The default 
   drivers, such as ``virtio-net-pci`` or ``vmxnet3``, are incompatible with 
   this configuration. Specifically, ICMP messages will not be processed correctly.

   To check your NIC driver, use the following command: :opcmd:`show interfaces ethernet
   eth0 physical | grep -i driver`

Cisco Catalyst configuration
============================

Configure a Cisco Catalyst switch to integrate with a two-member VyOS bonding 
interface.

Assign member interfaces to PortChannel:

.. code-block:: none

  interface GigabitEthernet1/0/23
   description VyOS eth1
   channel-group 1 mode active
  !
  interface GigabitEthernet1/0/24
   description VyOS eth2
   channel-group 1 mode active
  !

A new interface, ``Port-channel1``, becomes available; all configuration, 
such as allowed VLAN interfaces and STP, is applied here.

.. code-block:: none

  interface Port-channel1
   description LACP Channel for VyOS
   switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
   switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,100
   switchport mode trunk
   spanning-tree portfast trunk
  !


Juniper EX Switch configuration
===============================

Configure a Juniper EX Series switch to integrate with a two-member VyOS bonding 
interface.

.. code-block:: none

  # Create aggregated ethernet device with 802.3ad LACP and port speeds of 10gbit/s
  set interfaces ae0 aggregated-ether-options link-speed 10g
  set interfaces ae0 aggregated-ether-options lacp active

  # Create layer 2 on the aggregated ethernet device with trunking for our VLANs
  set interfaces ae0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching port-mode trunk

  # Add the required vlans to the device
  set interfaces ae0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 10
  set interfaces ae0 unit 0 family ethernet-switching vlan members 100

  # Add the two interfaces to the aggregated ethernet device, in this setup both
  # ports are on the same switch (switch 0, module 1, port 0 and 1)
  set interfaces xe-0/1/0 ether-options 802.3ad ae0
  set interfaces xe-0/1/1 ether-options 802.3ad ae0

  # But this can also be done with multiple switches in a stack, a virtual
  # chassis on Juniper (switch 0 and switch 1, module 1, port 0 on both switches)
  set interfaces xe-0/1/0 ether-options 802.3ad ae0
  set interfaces xe-1/1/0 ether-options 802.3ad ae0

Aruba/HP configuration
======================

Configure an Aruba/HP 2510G switch to integrate with a two-member VyOS bonding 
interface.

.. code-block:: none

  # Create trunk with 2 member interfaces (interface 1 and 2) and LACP
  trunk 1-2 Trk1 LACP

  # Add the required VLANs to the trunk
  vlan 10 tagged Trk1
  vlan 100 tagged Trk1

Arista EOS configuration
========================

When deploying VyOS in environments with Arista switches, use the following 
blueprint as an initial setup to configure an operational LACP port-channel 
between the two devices.

Let's assume the following topology:

     interface Ethernet4
        channel-group 20 mode active
     !

.. note:: When testing this environment in EVE-NG, ensure the e1000 driver 
   is chosen for your VyOS network interfaces. If the default virtio driver 
   is used, VyOS will not transmit LACP PDUs, preventing the port-channel 
   from ever becoming active.
