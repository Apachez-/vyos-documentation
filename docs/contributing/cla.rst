Contributor License Agreement
#############################

Before we can accept your contributions to VyOS, you must sign a **Contributor
License Agreement (CLA)**.

This is a standard open-source practice that protects both you and the project.

The process is straightforward and fully automated:

1. **Review the CLA document**

   Find the CLA text in our
   `GitHub repository <https://github.com/vyos/vyos-cla-signatures/>`__.

2. **Submit a pull request**

   When you open a pull request, a CLA bot automatically checks whether all
   commit authors have signed the CLA.

3. **Follow the bot's instructions**

   If the CLA has not been signed, the bot leaves a comment with instructions.
   Reply to that comment with the suggested text to sign the CLA.

4. **Wait for confirmation**

   The CLA bot verifies your response and updates the pull request status.
   Once all commit authors have signed, the bot confirms that the CLA
   requirement is met and unlocks the pull request for merging.

.. note::

   Each commit author must sign the CLA.

   If your pull request includes commits from multiple contributors, each one
   must sign the CLA before the pull request can be accepted.

Once you sign the CLA, it remains valid for all your past and future
contributions to VyOS under the same GitHub identity.
