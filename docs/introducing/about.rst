About
#####

VyOS is an open-source network operating system that provides a single unified 
CLI and API to manage routing protocols, firewall and NAT, QoS, load balancing, 
DHCP and DNS servers, and many other features.

VyOS runs on a wide variety of commodity hardware, virtual machines, and 
multiple cloud environments.

We provide a dedicated user guide for each major 
VyOS release that receives long-term support (LTS). We maintain multiple user 
guide versions, all hosted at https://docs.vyos.io. 
To switch between versions, select the appropriate version in the bottom-right 
corner.

VyOS CLI syntax may vary between major and sometimes minor releases. Always 
refer to the documentation matching your current running installation. If 
a change in the CLI is required, VyOS provides a migration script to handle 
the syntax adjustments. No user action is required.
